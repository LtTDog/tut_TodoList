This a simple html/javascript todo list.  This isn't my original creation, was part of colt steele's "The Web Developer Bootcamp" course on Udemy [https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

I'm running through the course to brush up on my skills and to fill in any gaps I have.
